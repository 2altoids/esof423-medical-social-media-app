Welcome to the user documentation for the Medical Social Network Project (M.S.N.P.).  This project is based on building a social network type website that will allow patients and clinicians to connect and exchange information related to health care. 

<h3>What does it do</h3>


<h3>Obtaining and Installing</h3>

As the M.S.N.P is a web-based application to access it you just need to go to the home page at [http://esofmsn.a2hosted.com/](http://esofmsn.a2hosted.com/)

<h3>Using the website</h3>

<h4>Registering an Account</h4>
To register a new account first go to the main page at [http://esofmsn.a2hosted.com/](http://esofmsn.a2hosted.com/).

Next click the green "register" button under the "login" button and "remember me" check box.

On the next form enter your new accounts information.  The required information is an Email Account, User name, and Password.  The Clinician ID field should only be filled out if you are a clinician.*
